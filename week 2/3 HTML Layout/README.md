# Week 2 Day 3 - HTML Layout

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to help students apply their recently learned flexbox skills in css/html, and to help them understand how to create a layout from an image. It might be worth while to draw the divs on a white board so they can understand why we nest things in divs. Knowing why and when to nest elements is always a sticking point for students.

## Lesson

You can either give them time to work on it or take lead right off the bat. Just be sure to emphasize how to think about the problem and why you are doing what you are doing.
