# Week 4 Day 2 - HTML Facebook Post

## Goal

Give the students time to practice building layouts with HTML/CSS

## Lesson

Spend the first 5-10 minutes going over the images talking about how you can break it down into smaller pieces and why you would make div's the way they are in the images. They don't need to make a perfect recreation, so just having it be colored boxes would be enough.

Spend the last 20 minutes or so building the site with them.
