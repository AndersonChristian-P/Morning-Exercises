# Week 2 Day 1 - Debugging Methodology

## Goal

The purpose of this guide is to help students understand the debugging process. We will set expectations and thought processes to help them learn how to do this on their own.

## Lesson

This lecture should be lead the whole time by the instructor. The goal is not to debug the code, but to show how we can come to conclusions.

First important topic to go over is what programming is based off of. I bring up the idea that everyone has heard stating `programming is the language of logic`. A statement that everyone claims to understand, until they are asked to define the word `logic`. Ask the students to define it, then go to google and define logic. Its still not the most helpful way of understanding what logic means but there is a synonymy that helps a lot, `argumentation`. When you look that up and you realize that `arguing` and `logic` are the same thing. But we need to specify further that when we say `arguing` we don't mean a heated debate, we man two parties discussing a topic with the intent to come to the truth of the matter. When it is between two people its about a 33-33 chance who is correct, with another 33% chance neither are correct. To be a good arguer is not someone who wins arguments, but someone that is committed to coming to truth, and being ok with examining their own beliefs and realizing they could be wrong.

So if you are going to be a good programmer you need to learn how to argue, from a logical standpoint. But a key difference here is that the computer is always right, and you are always wrong. And boy can that be frustrating. If you have not already there will come a time in your programing career where you will start arguing with your computer emotionally. You start telling the computer "NO! im right, that is how this works" and the computer just gives the same error and refuses to work. 

This is the processing of debugging. The debugger is only a tool that helps if you first understand this process. So today during the lecture we are going to spend time console.log ing and figruing out how to figure things out, or to call it by its correct term, how to `reason`

## Broken Problems

Every one of these problems is "finished" but does not work. With each one you can solve it by only modifying existing lines (make sure to communicate this to the students), there is no need to write more lines of code. The purpose of this is to teach the students how to troubleshoot and develop debugging skills/mindset. A trouble shooting mindset is more like a way of life than just a coding idea. These troubleshooting steps are universal and apply to any subject.

Typically the process starts at the Observation step. You may observe, "my code does not work" and that is a viable and helpful observation. From there you need to ask questions. Questions like, what does this line really do? One of the hardest things to do is learning to question your own assumptions, and even harder is realizing you are making assumptions. The goal from here is to get confirmations of your assumptions but performing experiments that will give you hard evidence to either prove or disprove your theories.

#### IMPORTANT
If all you do for these problems is solve the problems you will finish in about 5 minutes. But that is not the point of the problem. It is to teach the students how to perform tests. You should make it clear to the students that you don't want fixes, you want theory's, and how to we can test those theories.

1. Observation

2. Question your assumptions

3. Form Hypothesis

4. Experiment

5. Analysis

6. Conclusion
