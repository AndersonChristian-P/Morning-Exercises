# Week 2 Day 2 - Toy Problem

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to introduce the idea of problem solving with computers.

## Lesson

Start by taking the time to explain what problem solving is and what it is not. First, what problem is the purpose of programming? Students typically answer that programming is designed to solve problems, but I don't believe that is true. We as humans come up with the process to solve the problem, then we go to the computer to run our solution because it is very fast at those step.

Example of problem solving in schools:
```
2 + x = 5
```

What is the answer to this problem? `x = 3`. Thats great but after we do that is there any need to bring a computer into the equation? no. There is no need for computers if our values are static, but what if we had something like this?

```
y + x = z
```

If we know the values of `y` and `z` how do we figure out the value of `x`? If we do `z-x` every time we will always come up with the correct answer. Its that process is what we mean when we say problem solving in regards to computers and programming. There is a special word for this, called algorithms.

Algorithm creation is hard and an entirely separate skill from programming. Programming is the implementation of the algorithm, not the creation of the algorithm. I often hear students say they struggle with javascript/programming when what they really mean is they don't know how to solve problems. They jump right into coding before understanding the problem and then get confused and lost in their own heads.

There is a series of steps that if you follow will greatly improve your `problem solving/algorithm` skills.

```js
// Step 1: Clarify - Understand the question

// Step 2: Create multiple sample data

// Step 3: Solve your Sample Data

// Step 4: Break down the problem into its smallest pieces and how you solve the mini the problems.

// Step 5: Pseudo Code

// Step 6: Code
```

If you follow these and do them right, it will greatly increase your ability to problem solve


Then go into our fizz buzz problem and walk them through the process.
