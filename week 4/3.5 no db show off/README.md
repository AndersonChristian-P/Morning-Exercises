# Week 5 Day 3.5 - NO DB 

## Goal

To give students examples of what NO-DB Projects could look like

## Lesson

The mentors should show off what they did for their NO-DB project. This can help put students at ease and give them ideas of what to build. Coordinate with the instructor who is kicking off the ND-DB to see if they want to exclude this or even have it part of the kickoff.
