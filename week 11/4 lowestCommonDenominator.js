// You will be given a series of fractions in the form of nested arrays.
// E.G. an example argument would be [ [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4] ]
// Which would equate to 1/2, 1/3, and 1/4.

// Your job is to write a function that finds the lowest common denominator across all passed-in fractions.
// Then, convert all the fractions to the lowest common denominator, and return them as a string of parentheticals.
// For example, the above argument would return: "(6,12)(4,12)(3,12)"

// Do not assume there will be only 3 fractions.  Your function will need to account for an unknown number of nested arrays.

const fractionsOne = [[1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4]];
const fractionsTwo = [[3, 7], [8, 12], [7, 45]];
