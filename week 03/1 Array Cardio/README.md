# Week 3 Day 1 - Array Cardio One

## Goal

Improve students understanding and uses of popular array methods

## Lesson

Students often feel totally comfortable with array methods, so this is designed to help them combat that. Give the students time work on this on their own before you go over it with the whole class. Many of these are rough for students, like reduce. Again to help focus on data types show at least once that you can pass in a named function instead of using an anonymous arrow function.

I recommend asking every time, `what do we pass into .map .filter .foreach? A function`. Its crazy how quickly they forget that.
