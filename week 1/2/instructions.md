# Exercise

### lets practice gitting good at git! 😎

## Common Commands 💻

- `tab`: your best friend auto complete.
- `pwd`: print working directory, see the full path of the directory (aka: folder).
- `ls`: list, show all the items in the current directory.
- `cd`: change directory, allows you to move between folders.
- `.`: here, single dot means from the current directory.
- `cd ..`: up one level, goes up to the parent directory.
- `cd ../..`: goes up two levels, can be combined endlessly to move between folders.
- `~`: root directory, moves the terminal to the root directory.
- `clear`: clears out the terminal and all the text.
- `mkdir ____`: make directory: makes a folder with the provided name at the current directory.
- `touch`: make a file at the current directory.
- `rm`: remove file, this will only specifically remove a file.
- `rmdir` ____: deletes an empty directory.
- `rm -rf` ____: deletes all the content of a folder, forever, no return.
- `↕ arrows`: Re types out previous commands. God sent and huge time saver.
- `code .`: Opens vscode at this location.

## The Challenge 😅

We are going to be practicing moving around in the terminal and making files/folders. we will also be pushing this project up to gitHub for practice.

### Visualizing 👀

A big hurdle to understanding the command line is not being able to visualize or see what is going on. It can help to open your file explorer(windows)/finder(mac) so you can watch the changes happen as you make files and folders.

### Steps 🐾

1. Open up the terminal(mac)/bash(windows).
2. Using the `cd` navigate the terminal to the folder where you are keeping all you DevMtn folder.
    - 🔥 Challenge: only hit the enter key once.
3. Create a folder/directory called `cmd_line_challenge`.
4. Navigate inside the folder.
5. Create 3 directory's called `html` `css` and `js`.
    - 🔥 Challenge: Only hit the enter key once.
6. Navigate inside the `html` folder.
    - 🔥 Challenge: Do this by only typing 5 keys.
7. Create 3 files in here ending in `.html`.
    - 🔥 Challenge: only hit enter one time to create all 3 files
8. Navigate to the `css` folder.
    - 🔥 Challenge: Only hit the enter key once.
9.  Create 3 more files in the `css` folder, all ending with `.css`.
10. Move the `cmd_line_challenge` folder we are going to try some thing different for the `js` folder. 
    - 🤔 If you are not sure what folder you are in there is a command for it.
11. The Terminal is getting pretty messy at this point. Lets clean it up and remove all the content.
    - 🤓 Hint: Look at the common commands above.
12. Lets create 3 files inside the `js` folder, but do it from the `cmd_line_challenge` folder.
    - 🤓 Hint: We will need to combine `./js/` and the `touch` command.
13. Now move into the `html` folder and delete 2 files in the folder.
14. Move back to the `cmd_line_challenge` folder and try and delete 2 files in the `css` folder from the `cmd_line_challenge` folder.
15. Now lets delete the whole `js` folder and all the contents of it.
