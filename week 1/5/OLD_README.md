## Synopsis

It would be a good idea to watch all the videos under the Keyboard Cardio section in the repo called `vs-code-intro`, as that is all the content that you should cover in the exercise. Also, slacking out the repo is a good idea.

The sooner we introduce keyboard shortcuts the sooner the students can start go get these into their daily workflow. We can also catch bad habits sooner and hopefully give them good ones.

Emphasize that is is entirely possible to do every thing you need to in vscode with a keyboard shortcut. You can build muscle memory for the keyboard, but you can't for the mouse.

## Outline

I would just clone the `vs-code-into` repo and go over all the markdown files and just show how each shortcut works.
