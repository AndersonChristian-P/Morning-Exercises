# Instructor Guide

## Purpose

To help students understand how accessing objects works and having data nested inside other data. Also important to hit on the errors that will inevitably come up when working with objects.

## Lecture notes

I recommend giving students 20-30 minutes time to practice this before the exercise leader goes over it with them. When doing this exercise it is important that the leader messes up a fair number of times. An issue with experience is we often do it right so we don't run into errors and then the students think they are bad programmers if they have errors. errors you should be sure to run into are:

- `undefined`
- `cannot read property x of undefined`
